# React Library CRA Project
## Meta
This is a React Library Created by Ptolemy2002's [cra-template-react-library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ptolemy2002/cra-template-react-library) template in combination with [create-react-app](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-react-app). It contains methods of building and publishing your library to npm.
For now, the library makes use of React 18 and does not use TypeScript.

These should be installed in order to use the library, as npm does not automatically add peer dependencies to your project.
- @types/react: ^18.3.3
- @types/react-dom: ^18.3.0
- react: ^18.3.1
- react-dom: ^18.3.1
